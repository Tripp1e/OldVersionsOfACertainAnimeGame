# Download Old Versions of a certain Anime Game

First of all: Why? Why would you use an older Version? Well, to use MelonLoader. It has currently not been updated to 2.7, which means if you want to use mods, you'll have to install the old version of the game.

## How to downgrade

To install an older Version, download the file (it will take about an hour depending on your internet speed, be patient) and extract it into a Directory with Enough space. Then Download the Language file you want, rename the  to pkg_version (no file extension) and put it into the same folder as your ɢᴇɴꜱʜɪɴɪᴍᴘᴀᴄᴛ.exe.

To downgrade to an older verion of Grasscutter, click the Branches Section (left above the code) on the [Grasscutters/Grasscutter Repository](https://github.com/Grasscutters/Grasscutter) and select the corresponding Version. For Conveniences' Sake, I have put a link to the latest Brach of the Selected Version next to it. Just click on the green Code Button -> Download Zip. This is a big file, so it may take a while.

For Resources <b>(ONLY for OLDER Versions)</b> go to the [Koko-boya/Grasscutter_Resources Repository](https://github.com/Koko-boya/Grasscutter_Resources) and this time click on the "commits" text under the green Code Button. For Conveniences' Sake, I have again put a link to the latest Resources commit of the Selected Version next to it. Just click on the green Code Button -> Download Zip again. This is also a big file, but it is the last big file you will have to download.

Next download Grassclipper from the [Grasscutters/GrassClipper Repository](https://github.com/Grasscutters/GrassClipper). It doesnt matter which version you download, so just click on "Releases" on the left side and download GrassClipper.zip. Follow the [official Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIyIo7buJjI) for this. 

Now to install Grassclipper for your outdated verion, go into your GrassClipper\[dc-development or dc-stable]\Resources and delete every Folder inside it (You actually have to delete them, else it wont work). After that extract the previously dowloaded Resources Folder and put the Folders with the names of the ones that you just deleted into GrassClipper\[dc-development or dc-stable]\Resources

The Names of the Folders should be: BinOutput, ExcelBinOutput, Readable, Scripts, Subtitle, Textmap

Now extract your Grasscutter Folder (the one you downloaded at the beginning) and replace these files: <br>
-```GrassClipper\[gc-development or gc-stable]\data``` with ```Grasscutter\data``` <br>
-```GrassClipper\[gc-development or gc-stable]\grasscutter.jar``` with ```Grasscutter\grasscutter.jar``` <br>
-```GrassClipper\[gc-development or gc-stable]\keystore.p12``` with ```GrassCutter\keystore.p12``` <br>
-Copy ```GrassCutter\keys``` into ```GrassClipper\[gc-development or gc-stable]``` <br>
-Copy ```GrassCutter\proxy.py``` and ```GrassCutter\proxy_config.py``` into ```GrassClipper\proxy```

After that follow the instructions on the [lassedds/Melonloader-AnimeGaming Repository](https://github.com/lassedds/Melonloader-AnimeGaming)

Then simply point your Grassclipper to the ɢᴇɴꜱʜɪɴɪᴍᴘᴀᴄᴛ.exe of the Version you have installed.
